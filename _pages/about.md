Grilled Potato started out as an embarassing attempt to learn how to use git. Now, it is a project with a little more ambition, but still... rather embarassing. If Github Pages allowed free hosting with private repositories on its free subscription plans, this website would not be public.

Someday, this website will have good content. For now, I'm okay with it just being as accurately embarassing as possible.
